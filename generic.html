								<h3>My Certifications</h3>
								<p>In 2018 I earned my Adobe Certified Associate Cirtificate, I earned it while in highschool, not only does that show my dedication, but it also shows my time management skills. Projects and life have to have a cirtain balance, and thats what I love about rendering art. Renders take time, but you can play while you wait! </p>

								<p>In 2019, I started working for a Real Estate company in my town, they needed someone to help make both Video Ads, and Ads that would be printed! This tought me alot about how to design for a specific audience, as well as how to advertise. Keep in mind, while I was doing this, I was also in highschool working on finishing classes.</p>

								<hr />

								<h4>History</h4>
								<p>Currently I work with KUBO Studios as an Intern for Graphic Design, and Digital art! I am enjoying my time here, with many people by my side helping me along with projects.</p>

								<p>Hard work doesn't have to be 'hard'. Everyone goes at there own pace, not all of us work the same speed, or have the best quality. Pacing matters, without it you may just end up dried up.
									This is why time management and an 'anti-clockwork' attitude is something I have adopted. Working with people over the years has proved to be both challenging AND rewarding. Sometimes I wish I could quit,
									other times I keep pushing, its all about how you look at it, and maybe even picking your poison.
